# Diabetic-Retinopathy

Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened. Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospitalâ€™s ability to identify potential patients.


## Data  
A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:
- 0 - No DR
- 1 - Mild
- 2 - Moderate
- 3 - Severe
- 4 - Proliferative DR

Like any real-world data set, you will encounter noise in both the images and labels. Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

**Accuracy obtained - ~88%**
